  <p>去年11月，读完了从图书馆借来的 <em>Great Expectaions</em> 之后，想到书店买一本来收藏。就对老婆谎称去沃尔玛购物，偷偷跑到了 Barnes & Noble。在那里没找到喜欢的版本，但是看到他们自家的经典小说系列在搞买二送一的促销活动，就买了 <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>, <em>David Copperfield</em>, <em>Bleak House</em>, 因为这三本里的插图我都很喜欢。</p>

  <p>前两本都没有提到那些插图的作者，在第三本的简名页 (half title page) 看到是 Phiz。后来在网上查到那是 Hablot K. Browne 的笔名，这三本书的插图都是他画的。狄更斯不喜欢《双城记》里的插图，因为它们不符合该小说的悲剧氛围，后来 Phiz 再也没有为狄更斯画过插图。有兴趣的网友可以到这个<a href="http://charlesdickenspage.com/illustrations.html">狄更斯发烧友网站</a>鉴定一下自己的品味, </p>

  <p>读《远大前程》前后花了可能有五个月，前半部分觉得很枯燥，硬着头皮读了两边。文中有几个角色比如 Joe 是文盲，我猜狄更斯为此加了很多拼写和语法错误，对于英语不太灵的老包来说就是雪上加霜。</p>

  <p>《双城记》里大概没有文盲，只有一个门童兼信使 Jerry 文化程度不太高，所以文字就通顺了许多。但是它的前一半还是比较乏味，我还是读了两遍。后面的情节渐入佳境，很快就读完了。前后历时六个月。</p>

  <p>文中有些段落比较有趣，就摘抄下来。</p>

  <h2>第一卷 Recalled to Life</h2>

  <h3>第一章 Recalled to life</h3>

  <h4>关于时代（老包注，下同）</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way --</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>第四章 The wine-shop</h3>
  <h4>关于饥饿</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sign, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and stared up from the filthy street that had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>第二卷 The Golden Thread</h2>

  <h3>第一章 Five years later</h3>

  <h4>关于打工仔</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When they took a young man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>第13章 The fellow without delicacy</h3>

  <h4>关于暗恋</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you—ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn—the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>第三卷 The Track of a Storm</h2>

  <h3>第九章 The game made</h3>

  <h4>关于谎言</h4>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That honest tradesman’s manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention;</p>
